Another disclaimer: I say home as in the place where I live, not as in /home/marx. Although I suppose it works either way.
Which software? Restic The backup tool. I chose it first and invented a justification after, so, no point in pretending there is a good motive. But that is philosophical matter.
It does backup stuff, that is what&amp;rsquo;s important.
Rclone Restic supports a handful of repository types, alas the one I need is not one of them.</description></item><item><title>A Lawless Land Ruled by Dots</title><link>https://setsevireon.dev/post/xdgdir/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 09:13:32 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://setsevireon.dev/post/xdgdir/</guid><description>Everybody (maybe not) loves standards. It makes life much easier as you don&amp;rsquo;t have to make unnecessary choices and helps to keep compatibility between software. The problem is a paradox, we like standards, we just don&amp;rsquo;t like the ones that already exist, what we really want, is to create a new, better and universal one, and if others do not like, they are just wrong.
When it comes to directory hierarchy, we are well-served.</description></item><item><title>Hello!</title><link>https://setsevireon.dev/post/hello/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 02:05:52 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://setsevireon.dev/post/hello/</guid><description>Hello!</description></item></channel></rss>
